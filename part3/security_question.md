# OWASP Top 10 Security Analysis

Since this startup handles sensitive customer data like passwords and contact information, security is very important. Here are some key areas I would focus on based on OWASP Top 10:

## A1:2021 - Broken Access Control
- Implement role-based access controls for employees. Limit employee access to only what they need.
- Use authentication and authorization for all REST APIs.

## A2:2021 - Cryptographic Failures
- Store passwords hashed and salted in the database.
- Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest. Use HTTPS and database encryption.

## A3:2021 - Injection
- Sanitize and validate all inputs on the frontend and backend to prevent SQL injection.

## A4:2021 - Insecure Design
- Follow secure design principles like least privilege and fail-safe defaults.

## A5:2021 - Security Misconfiguration
- Use infrastructure as code and immutable infrastructure to prevent misconfigurations.

## A6:2021 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components
- Continuously scan for vulnerable libraries and dependencies. Establish an update process.

## A7:2021 - Identification and Authentication Failures
- Implement multi-factor authentication for employees and users.

## A8:2021 - Software and Data Integrity Failures
- Use code signing and hashing to verify software integrity.

## A9:2021 - Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
- Implement comprehensive logging, monitoring, and alerting.

## A10:2021 - Server-Side Request Forgery
- Add CSRF tokens to forms to prevent SSRF attacks.
